Radiance of light,
Contradicts the thick darkness.
Now covered in snow.

Our wings now frozen,
Can only be saved by the slow,
Fall of sinking bricks.

The sound of snapping strings,
Only silenced by the sky:
Your dim pure blue eyes.

In this long, lost haven
The cold cannot reach you here
My fallen angel

Red line of wool cloth
Forgetting the one purpose
Snapping turned to bliss

Anguish on the journey
In the chattering of millions
Only our voices remain

Chances ruined for now,
My unsteady hand steadied,
By the sea and fire.

My unfortunate Muses,
our fierce and fateful winds;
Will meet up again.

No adequate space,
To express what I have felt.
Only my truest loves.

What I rely on
Is the chance against all odds
In this great small world
 
This merciless time
Ravaging me like a beast
Things left unfinished
 
Once in a lifetime
We shall watch the red comet
And savour our past

The land of decay
Is where the Sakura blooms
I, the rightful king
 
On top of mountains
The cold thaws by force of will
Inner peace, at last
 
I have awakened,
But still not much has since changed
Stand tall, go forth!

Sounding melody,
The sun has set for a while,
Until next time, friends!

Big revelations,
Even in my great absence,
The world keeps spinning.

Time has surely passed
Fractions of our memories
Now melting like snow
 
Like interlinked strings,
Heaven and earth will collide,
Till they move as one.
 
Mist embraces earth
That too, depends on how much,
the sky is crying
 
Alas hopefully,
Even the sun shivers now,
The sight of respect.
 
The shivering sun
Fades away in the dark sky
Devoured by feelings

The radiant cross,
With sharp edges impales me,
Bring it back, the light.
 
Always, our god sleeps,
While its children start a fire,
Flames dance at night-time.

Deprived of music,
Our life begins to lack rhythm,
Stops like a heartbeat
 
Whispers among leaves
Sometimes louder than a cry
The merciful wind

Words that are unknown
Even through the greatest loss
You stand by my side

Woke up in great stress
In my visions I have seen
A world without you

Haunted by sunlight
The centre no longer seen
Silence is music

The 3 days of rain
Bring serenity to mind
Time to reassess
 
The raid of droplets
Although weak, can demolish
The greatest fortress

Your image like truth,
Among the few things I'd keep
On the verge of war

It has been so long
I have almost forgotten
How it feels to feel
 
Wandering alone
I walk into deep pitfalls
You're the only light
 
Once more I can see
Things have changed and keep changing
Life bids us goodbye
 
The thoughts that run through
Will surely bring great regrets
For my heart adapts

Contemplate on this:
Time and mere thoughts are enough,
To grasp the whole world.

Imminent sunrise
I won't scatter your sorrow
To the heartless sea

When facing the sun
Along with vision we lose
Our greatest virtues
 
No clouds in the sky
I am left to fight alone
With the blinding sun

One long fateful night,
Our fondest dreams will shatter
Kingdoms built on words.

The great forceful wind,
Drains away on this poor land,
Yet these lives stand firm.
 
Lonely cries are near,
Wishes heard loud and clear.
Return, to your fear.

With a leap of faith,
Entering the devil's lair,
Only to find love.

The days of absence,
This distance that keeps growing,
They all drown my heart.

Fire kissed fingertips,
Temptation to pure chaos,
Embers seeketh ash.
 
My hand like a stone,
Unaffected by the times,
Great grip of the heart.

In the coldest night,
Colours shimmer in the dark,
Paramount lone star.
 
The fleeting landscape,
Is running from divine wrath.
The fire keeps fading.
 
This sustained sickness,
Makes it hard to fight against,
The conflict within.

Let the truth be known,
Of all the tragedies that,
Fall upon this place.

With unclear conscious,
I don't even recognize,
My recollections.

Your slight-tilted head,
Weighs heavy on my arm,
Marked for a vain death.
 
Absorbed in your world,
You turn around to see what,
You have sadly missed.
 
It is truly sad,
How the ocean's turning tides
Are now against me.
 
Some contracts broken
Some gaze remains nullified.
All; go through judgement.
 
Boiling heart depths
Pacifism carries a price;
Release the great storm.

Speaking through these signs,
Love, perhaps, feels simplistic:
Symbols take over.
 
On a lonely night,
Signs of death keep me awake,
Let's talk a bit more.

Agonies of space:
My stiff heart or those of time;
Impalement of it.
 
To be around fire,
And yet to not sleep near hearth,
Is a new blessing.
 
At angle and distance,
Only rosy fingertips,
Dissolve in the sky.

In between two cliffs,
Azure pools in white sand dunes,
The continent looms.
 
Over the ocean,
And the evening white sky,
Blue eyes and blonde hair.
 
Wind serenity,
And premonition in mind,
We sleep in embrace.
 
The morning is gloom,
Looking to the horizon,
Divide of the mind.
 
The feeling is weird,
To witness separation,
And sit in the mist.

The world is changing.
In the hour of this madness,
I seek origins.
 
Beyond horizons,
This interstellar star-scourge
Plagues both my vessels.
 
Sometimes it's better,
To keep vanity unnamed,
Such words manifest.
 
My heart lies somewhere,
Looking over the ocean,
Or in your embrace.
 
The poison that boils,
Deep within my rotten blood,
Morbid suspicions.
 
A trade has been made
My soul has been deeply stained
An eye for an eye
 
It's been a long time,
Memories pulled me back here,
Words written in stone.
 
The river of time,
Carries scrambled paper that,
Only the rocks hold.
 
The views I've missed most,
Of the golden fields and seas
Spanning across home.
