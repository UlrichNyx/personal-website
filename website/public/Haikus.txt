Radiance of light,
contradicts the thick darkness.
Now, covered in snow.

Our wings now frozen,
can only be saved by the slow,
fall of sinking bricks.

The sound of snapping strings,
only silenced by the sky:
your dim pure blue eyes.

In this long, lost haven,
the cold cannot reach you here,
my fallen angel.

Red line of wool cloth,
forgetting the one purpose;
snapping turned to bliss.

Anguish on the journey,
in the chattering of millions,
only our voices remain.

Chances ruined for now,
my unsteady hand steadied,
by the sea and fire.

My unfortunate Muses,
our fierce and fateful winds;
will meet up again.

No adequate space,
to express what I have felt.
Only my truest loves.

What I rely on,
is the chance against all odds,
in this great small world.
 
This merciless time,
ravaging me like a beast,
things left unfinished.
 
Once in a lifetime,
we shall watch the red comet,
and savour our past.

The land of decay,
is where the Sakura blooms,
I, the rightful king.
 
On top of mountains,
the cold thaws by force of will.
Inner peace, at last.
 
I have awakened,
but still not much has since changed.
Stand tall, go forth!

Sounding melody,
the sun has set for a while.
Until next time, friends!

Big revelations,
even in my great absence,
the world keeps spinning.

Time has surely passed.
Fractions of our memories,
now melting like snow.
 
Like interlinked strings,
heaven and earth will collide,
till they move as one.
 
Mist embraces earth,
that too, depends on how much,
the sky is crying.
 
Alas hopefully,
even the sun shivers now,
the sight of respect.
 
The shivering sun,
fades away in the dark sky,
devoured by feelings.

The radiant cross,
with sharp edges impales me.
Bring it back, the light.
 
Always, our god sleeps,
while its children start a fire.
Flames dance at night-time.

Deprived of music,
our life begins to lack rhythm;
stops like a heartbeat.
 
Whispers among leaves,
sometimes louder than a cry.
The merciful wind.

Words that are unknown,
even through the greatest loss,
you stand by my side.

Woke up in great stress,
in my visions I have seen,
a world without you.

Haunted by sunlight,
the centre no longer seen.
Silence is music.

The 3 days of rain,
bring serenity to mind.
Time to reassess.
 
The raid of droplets,
although weak, can demolish;
the greatest fortress.

Your image like truth,
among the few things I'd keep;
on the verge of war.

It has been so long,
I have almost forgotten,
how it feels to feel.
 
Wandering alone,
I walk into deep pitfalls.
You're the only light.
 
Once more I can see,
things have changed and keep changing.
Life bids us goodbye.
 
The thoughts that run through,
will surely bring great regrets.
For my heart adapts.

Contemplate on this:
Time and mere thoughts are enough,
To grasp the whole world.

Imminent sunrise,
I won't scatter your sorrow,
to the heartless sea.

When facing the sun,
along with vision we lose,
our greatest virtues.
 
No clouds in the sky,
I am left to fight alone,
with the blinding sun.

One long fateful night,
our fondest dreams will shatter.
Kingdoms built on words.

The great forceful wind,
drains away on this poor land,
yet these lives stand firm.
 
Lonely cries are near,
wishes heard loud and clear.
Return, to your fear.

With a leap of faith,
entering the devil's lair,
Only to find love.

The days of absence,
this distance that keeps growing,
They all drown my heart.

Fire kissed fingertips,
temptation to pure chaos,
Embers seeketh ash.
 
My hand like a stone,
unaffected by the times.
Great grip of the heart.

In the coldest night,
colours shimmer in the dark.
Paramount lone star.
 
The fleeting landscape,
is running from divine wrath.
The fire keeps fading.
 
This sustained sickness,
makes it hard to fight against;
the conflict within.

Let the truth be known,
of all the tragedies that;
fall upon this place.

With unclear conscious,
I don't even recognize;
my recollections.

Your slight-tilted head,
weighs heavy on my arm.
Marked for a vain death.
 
Absorbed in your world,
you turn around to see what,
you have sadly missed.
 
It is truly sad,
how the ocean's turning tides,
are now against me.
 
Some contracts broken,
some gaze remains nullified.
All; go through judgement.
 
Boiling heart depths,
pacifism carries a price;
release the great storm.

Speaking through these signs,
Love, perhaps, feels simplistic:
Symbols take over.
 
On a lonely night,
signs of death keep me awake.
Let's talk a bit more.

Agonies of space:
My stiff heart or those of time;
impalement of it.
 
To be around fire,
and yet to not sleep near hearth,
is a new blessing.
 
At angle and distance,
only rosy fingertips,
dissolve in the sky.

In between two cliffs,
azure pools in white sand dunes.
The continent looms.
 
Over the ocean;
and the evening white sky;
blue eyes and blonde hair.
 
Wind serenity;
and premonition in mind.
We sleep in embrace.
 
The morning is gloom,
looking to the horizon,
Divide of the mind.
 
The feeling is weird,
to witness separation;
and sit in the mist.

The world is changing.
in the hour of this madness,
I seek origins.
 
Beyond horizons,
this interstellar star-scourge,
plagues both my vessels.
 
Sometimes it's better,
to keep vanity unnamed.
Such words manifest.
 
My heart lies somewhere,
looking over the ocean,
or in your embrace.
 
The poison that boils,
deep within my rotten blood,
morbid suspicions.
 
A trade has been made,
my soul has been deeply stained,
an eye for an eye.
 
It's been a long time,
memories pulled me back here.
Words written in stone.
 
The river of time,
carries scrambled paper that,
only the rocks hold.
 
The views I've missed most,
of the golden fields and seas,
spanning across home.
